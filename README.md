# Network-topology-Cisco
This is in problem statement of cyber security of 2023
Problem Statement: Choose a university/college campus and analyze its network topology. Map the network using Cisco Packet Tracer and identify the security controls that are in place, such as network segmentation, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and authentication and authorization systems. Apply the knowledge gained from the NetAcad cyber security course to conduct an attack surface mapping, aiming to identify potential entry points for cyber-attacks, Propose countermeasures to mitigate these risks.
Tasks:
1. Campus Network Analysis: Choose a university or college campus and conduct an analysis of its existing network topology, including the layout, devices, and connections.
2. Network Mapping: Utilize Cisco Packet Tracer to map the network infrastructure, representing the placement and interconnectivity of routers, switches, firewalls, and other relevant network components.
3. Attack Surface Mapping: Conduct an attack surface mapping exercise to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses within the network architecture and design, considering factors such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and network availability.
4. Secure Access Controlls: incorporate appropriate security controls (e.g., VLANs, IDP/IPS, VPN, Firewalls, password management, vulnerability management etc.) in your design to enhance security posture.
Deliverables:
1. Network topology diagram depicting the existing infrastructure and attack surface findings.
2. Security assessment report highlighting identified security risks, proposed solutions, and countermeasures to mitigate attack surface risks.
